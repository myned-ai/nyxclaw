# ZeroClaw Avatar Channel Patch

Patches for ZeroClaw **v0.5.0** that add a dedicated avatar WebSocket channel (`/ws/avatar`) for nyxclaw voice+avatar integration.

## What this patch does

When connected via `/ws/avatar`, ZeroClaw forces the LLM to respond with structured JSON:

```json
{"speech": "Here's what I found, take a look.", "content": "**Rome - Wikipedia**\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"}
```

- `speech` — sent to nyxclaw as `speech_chunk` events → avatar speaks it
- `content` — sent to nyxclaw as `rich_content` event → app renders cards/links/tables
- Tool calls/results stream in real-time during agent execution
- Tool call fillers — avatar speaks contextual phrases (e.g. "Let me search for that") while tools execute
- Cancel support for barge-in interruption

The existing `/ws/chat` endpoint is unchanged — CLI and web dashboard clients work as before.

## Usage

### Bash (Linux/macOS)
```bash
./patch.sh /path/to/zeroclaw-v0.5.0
```

### PowerShell (Windows)
```powershell
.\patch.ps1 -ZeroClawDir C:\path\to\zeroclaw-v0.5.0
```

Both scripts:
- Back up original files to `.nyxclaw-patch-backup/`
- Copy patched/new files into place
- Verify all files were applied

### After patching
```bash
cd /path/to/zeroclaw-v0.5.0
cargo build
cargo test
cargo run -- gateway
```

nyxclaw connects to `ws://<host>:<port>/ws/avatar` instead of `/ws/chat`.

## Authentication

ZeroClaw uses bearer tokens for WebSocket auth. nyxclaw sends the token as a `?token=` query parameter on the WebSocket connection.

### Getting the token

Generate a pairing token inside the ZeroClaw container:

```bash
docker exec <zeroclaw-container> zeroclaw gateway get-paircode --new
```

This prints a token like `zc_abc123def456...`. Copy it.

### Configuring nyxclaw

Add the token to nyxclaw's `.env`:

```env
AGENT_TYPE=zeroclaw
BASE_URL=http://<zeroclaw-host>:<port>
AUTH_TOKEN=zc_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
USE_AVATAR_ENDPOINT=true
```

nyxclaw will connect to `ws://<host>:<port>/ws/avatar?token=<AUTH_TOKEN>`.

## AGENTS.md — Required prompt addition

You must manually add the following **Response format** section to your `playground/AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Response format

Your responses are consumed by a voice + avatar system. Every response you generate is a JSON object with two fields:

\`\`\`json
{"speech": "...", "content": "..."}
\`\`\`

### `speech` — what the avatar says aloud
- Keep it concise and conversational — this is spoken, not read.
- Never include URLs, table data, code, or markdown syntax in speech.
- When you have rich content to show, use a brief phrase: "Check this out", "Here's what I found", "Take a look."
- For simple conversational responses (greetings, opinions, short answers), just put the full response in speech.

### `content` — what appears in the chat (rich content)
- Put URLs, links, tables, code snippets, structured data, and detailed information here.
- Use markdown formatting — the app renders it.
- Set to empty string `""` when there's nothing visual to show — including error messages, apologies, explanations, and status updates. Only use `content` for URLs, tables, code, or structured data.
- If you browsed a URL the user asked for, put the URL here.
- If you compared items, put a markdown table here.
- If you found search results, put the links here.

### Examples

Simple greeting:
\`\`\`json
{"speech": "Hey, what's up?", "content": ""}
\`\`\`

User asks for a link:
\`\`\`json
{"speech": "Here's the Wikipedia page for Rome, take a look.", "content": "**Rome - Wikipedia**\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome\n\nRome is the capital city of Italy."}
\`\`\`

User asks to compare things:
\`\`\`json
{"speech": "Here's the comparison, check it out.", "content": "| Feature | iPhone 15 | Samsung S24 |\n|---------|-----------|-------------|\n| Screen | 6.1\" | 6.2\" |\n| Battery | 3349mAh | 4000mAh |"}
\`\`\`

### Never do this
- Never put URLs in speech
- Never narrate table data in speech
- Never leave speech empty — always say something
- Never put raw JSON or code in speech
- Never put error messages or apologies in content — those belong in speech only
```

## Performance Tuning

For real-time voice, latency matters. These ZeroClaw settings reduce time-to-first-token (TTFT) significantly. Edit your `config.toml` (located at `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml`, or `/zeroclaw-data/.zeroclaw/config.toml` inside Docker):

```toml
default_temperature = 0.5
provider_timeout_secs = 30

[agent]
compact_context = true
max_tool_iterations = 4
max_history_messages = 15
max_context_tokens = 12000
parallel_tools = true

[runtime]
reasoning_enabled = false
```

### What each setting does

| Setting | Default | Recommended | Effect |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `default_temperature` | `0.7` | `0.5` | Less sampling overhead, slightly faster token selection |
| `provider_timeout_secs` | `120` | `30` | Fail fast instead of hanging on slow requests |
| `compact_context` | `false` | `true` | Reduces system prompt and context payload sent to the LLM |
| `max_tool_iterations` | `10` | `4` | Limits tool-call round-trips per turn (each is a full LLM call) |
| `max_history_messages` | `50` | `15` | Less conversation history = fewer input tokens = faster TTFT |
| `max_context_tokens` | `32000` | `12000` | Triggers context compaction sooner, keeping payload lean |
| `parallel_tools` | `false` | `true` | Runs multiple tool calls concurrently instead of sequentially |
| `reasoning_enabled` | `false` | `false` | Keep disabled — reasoning adds seconds of thinking delay |

### Model selection

Model choice is the single biggest latency factor. Fast options:

| Model | Provider | TTFT | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| `gpt-4.1-mini` | `openai` | ~1s | Good balance of speed and quality |
| `gpt-4.1-nano` | `openai` | ~0.5s | Fastest, lower quality |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | `anthropic` | ~0.8s | Fast, good quality |
| `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | `groq` | ~0.3s | Groq LPU hardware, very fast |

Set in `config.toml`:
```toml
default_provider = "openai"
default_model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
```

### Automatic optimizations (no config needed)

- **Streaming** — the avatar channel uses `turn_with_streaming()` which streams tokens as they arrive. Speech starts as soon as the first sentence is complete.
- **Prompt caching** — OpenAI automatically caches prompt prefixes (system prompt + tools). This patch removes the `DateTimeSection` (which changed every second and invalidated the cache). With a stable system prompt, cache hit rates of 95-99% are typical after the first call, reducing TTFT by up to 50%.
- **HTTP warmup** — ZeroClaw pre-warms provider HTTP connection pools (TLS + HTTP/2) at startup, eliminating cold-start latency on the first request.
- **Response caching** — set `response_cache_enabled = true` in `[memory]` and `temperature = 0.0` to cache responses for repeated queries. Useful for common greetings or FAQ-type questions.

### Identity prompt size

Your `playground/AGENTS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `SOUL.md` files are injected into the system prompt. Larger files = more input tokens = higher TTFT. Keep them concise for voice use cases.

These values are optimized for snappy voice responses. Depending on your use case you may want different tradeoffs — for example, raising `max_history_messages` for longer conversations, enabling `reasoning_enabled` for complex tasks, or increasing `max_tool_iterations` if your agent uses many tools. Experiment and find what works best for your setup.

## Rich Content Thumbnails

nyxclaw automatically enriches `rich_content` URLs with link card metadata (title, description, thumbnail) by scraping OpenGraph tags from each page. This works for most sites, but pages behind Cloudflare or bot protection will block the scrape and fall back to a low-quality favicon.

To provide high-quality thumbnails for all sites, tools can include **thumbnail hints** in their output. nyxclaw picks these up from `tool_result` events and uses them as fallbacks when OGP scraping fails.

### How it works

1. Your tool appends a `---THUMBNAIL_HINTS---` footer to its text output
2. ZeroClaw sends the output in the `tool_result` event (this already happens — no channel changes needed)
3. nyxclaw parses the footer, stores URL-to-thumbnail mappings for the current turn
4. When `rich_content` arrives with those URLs, nyxclaw uses the hints for any card where OGP scraping failed

### Thumbnail hints format

Append this to your tool's output text:

```
---THUMBNAIL_HINTS---
https://example.com/article	https://cdn.example.com/thumb1.jpg
https://other.com/page	https://cdn.example.com/thumb2.jpg
```

- Sentinel line `---THUMBNAIL_HINTS---` marks the start
- One mapping per line, tab-separated: `page_url<TAB>thumbnail_url`
- Only include URLs that have thumbnails — missing URLs are fine
- The LLM sees this footer but ignores it (no conversational value)

### Per-provider examples

Each search provider returns thumbnails differently. Here's how to extract them:

**Brave Search API** (already implemented in our deployment):
```rust
// result.thumbnail.src contains the pre-crawled thumbnail
if let Some(thumb) = result.get("thumbnail").and_then(|t| t.get("src")).and_then(|s| s.as_str()) {
    thumbnail_hints.push((url.to_string(), thumb.to_string()));
}
```

**Serper API** (Google Search):
```python
# result["imageUrl"] or result["thumbnailUrl"]
thumb = result.get("imageUrl") or result.get("thumbnailUrl")
```

**Tavily API**:
```python
# result["image"] contains the thumbnail
thumb = result.get("image")
```

**Custom tool / web_fetch**:
```python
# If your tool fetches a page and finds og:image, pass it through
thumb = extract_og_image(html)  # your own extraction
```

### Thumbnail cascade

nyxclaw applies thumbnails in this order (per URL):

1. **OGP scrape** — fetches `og:image` from the actual page (~70% success rate)
2. **Provider thumbnail hint** — used when OGP scraping failed or returned only a favicon
3. **Favicon fallback** — Google favicons API (always works, low quality)

If your tool doesn't provide hints, everything still works — nyxclaw falls back to OGP + favicon automatically.

## WebSocket Protocol: `/ws/avatar`

### Client → Server

```json
{"type": "connect", "session_id": "...", "device_name": "...", "capabilities": ["avatar"]}
{"type": "message", "content": "What is the Wikipedia page for Rome?"}
{"type": "cancel"}
```

### Server → Client

```json
{"type": "session_start", "session_id": "abc123", "resumed": false, "message_count": 0}
{"type": "connected", "message": "Connection established"}
{"type": "tool_call", "name": "web_fetch", "args": {"url": "..."}}
{"type": "tool_result", "name": "web_fetch", "output": "...", "success": true, "duration_ms": 1200}
{"type": "speech_chunk", "content": "Here's the Wikipedia page for Rome, take a look."}
{"type": "speech_chunk", "content": "Let me look that up for you.", "filler": true}
{"type": "rich_content", "content": "**Rome - Wikipedia**\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome\n\n..."}
{"type": "done", "full_response": "Here's the Wikipedia page for Rome, take a look."}
{"type": "error", "message": "..."}
```

**`speech_chunk` fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `content` | `string` | Text for the avatar to speak |
| `filler` | `bool` (optional) | If `true`, this is a contextual filler phrase generated during tool execution (e.g. "Let me search for that"). nyxclaw uses this to apply throttling (2s gap between fillers, 5s same-content cooldown). Omitted or `false` for normal speech. |

### Key differences from `/ws/chat`

| Feature | `/ws/chat` | `/ws/avatar` |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Response format | Raw text | Structured `{speech, content}` JSON |
| Streaming events | `done` only | `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `speech_chunk`, `rich_content`, `done` |
| Cancel support | No | Yes (`{"type": "cancel"}`) |
| LLM constraint | `response_format` not set | `response_format: json_schema` enforced |

## How it works

### Files modified

**Full file replacements (patched copies in `src/`):**

| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/providers/traits.rs` | Added `response_format` to `ChatRequest`, `StreamEvent` enum, `stream_chat()` trait method. |
| `src/providers/openai.rs` | Added `response_format` + `stream` to `NativeChatRequest`, SSE streaming structs, `stream_chat()` impl. |
| `src/agent/agent.rs` | Added `response_format` field + setter, `turn_with_events()`, `turn_with_streaming()` (streaming agent turn). |
| `src/agent/prompt.rs` | Removed `DateTimeSection` from system prompt builder. The per-second timestamp was invalidating OpenAI's prompt cache on every request. User messages already carry timestamps, so the LLM still knows the current time. |
| `src/channels/nyxclaw.rs` | **NEW** — Avatar WebSocket channel with incremental JSON extraction, cancel support, and tool call fillers. Streams `speech_chunk` events as the LLM generates, not after. Emits contextual filler phrases (`filler: true`) during tool execution. |

**Line injections (original files preserved):**

| File | What injected |
|------|--------------|
| `src/agent/loop_.rs` | `response_format: None,` in `ChatRequest` construction (1 location) |
| `src/providers/anthropic.rs` | `response_format: None,` in `ProviderChatRequest` construction (1 location) |
| `src/providers/reliable.rs` | `response_format: None,` in `ChatRequest` constructions (6 locations) + `stream_chat()` delegation |
| `src/providers/mod.rs` | `StreamEvent` added to re-export list |
| `Cargo.toml` | `async-stream = "0.3"` dependency added |
| `src/channels/mod.rs` | `pub mod nyxclaw;` after `pub mod notion;` |
| `src/gateway/mod.rs` | `use crate::channels::nyxclaw;` import + `/ws/avatar` route + print line |

## Compatibility

- **ZeroClaw v0.5.0** — tested and supported
- **Other versions** — may require manual adjustments to `gateway/mod.rs` and `channels/mod.rs`

### Provider support

| Provider | Structured output | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| `openai` | `response_format: json_schema` | **Patched** |
| `azure_openai` | Same API as OpenAI | Not patched (see guide below) |
| `openrouter` | Passes through to model | Not patched (see guide below) |
| `compatible` | OpenAI-compatible API | Not patched (see guide below) |
| `anthropic` | Requires forced tool calling (different mechanism) | Not supported yet |
| `gemini` | `response_mime_type` + `response_schema` | Not supported yet |
| `ollama` | `format: "json"` (partial) | Not supported yet |
| Others | — | Fallback: speech-only, no rich content |

When using an unpatched provider, the avatar channel falls back gracefully — the LLM response is sent as `speech_chunk` (the avatar speaks it) but no `rich_content` cards are generated.

### Patching additional providers

If your provider uses the OpenAI-compatible API (`azure_openai`, `openrouter`, `compatible`), you can patch it yourself. The pattern is the same for all OpenAI-compatible providers:

**Step 1:** Find the `NativeChatRequest` struct in `src/providers/<your_provider>.rs`:

```rust
struct NativeChatRequest {
    model: String,
    messages: Vec<...>,
    temperature: f64,
    tools: Option<...>,
    tool_choice: Option<String>,
}
```

**Step 2:** Add the `response_format` field:

```rust
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    tool_choice: Option<String>,
    // ── nyxclaw patch: structured output ──
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    response_format: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}
```

**Step 3:** Find the `chat()` method where `NativeChatRequest` is constructed. Look for `tool_choice: tools.as_ref().map(|_| "auto"...` and add the `response_format` field after it:

```rust
    tool_choice: tools.as_ref().map(|_| "auto".to_string()),
    // ── nyxclaw patch: pass through response_format ──
    response_format: request.response_format.cloned(),
    tools,
```

**Step 4:** Find `chat_with_tools()` (if it exists) and add `response_format: None,` to its `NativeChatRequest` construction.

**Step 5:** Build and test:
```bash
cargo build
cargo test -p zeroclaw --lib providers::<your_provider>
```

### Anthropic / Gemini — different approach needed

Anthropic and Gemini use different APIs for structured output:

- **Anthropic**: Requires `tool_choice: {"type": "tool", "name": "respond"}` with a forced tool whose schema includes `speech` and `content` fields. This is architecturally different from `response_format`.
- **Gemini**: Uses `generationConfig.response_mime_type: "application/json"` + `generationConfig.response_schema: {...}`.

These require provider-specific patches beyond the OpenAI pattern. Contributions welcome.
